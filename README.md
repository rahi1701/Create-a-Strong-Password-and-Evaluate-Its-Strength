Task - 6 Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
======
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

# Step - 1 Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.

# Password Strength Analysis & Tips
```

1. Length: 14 characters ✅

Good — anything above 12 is generally strong.

2. Character Variety ✅

Lowercase letters: c, z, v, k, i

Uppercase letters: E, O, A

Digits: 0

Symbols: (, #, $, !, @
✔️ Contains all four character types — Excellent!

3. Randomness: Appears random and non-dictionary-based
✔️ No recognizable patterns or words — Great for resisting dictionary and pattern-based attacks.

4. Brute-force Resistance:
✔️ High — with current computing power, this would take centuries or longer to crack using offline brute-force methods.

# Password Strength Analysis & Tips
```
1. Length: 21 characters ✅

Very strong — the longer, the better for security.

2. Character Variety ✅

Uppercase letters: T, R, N, P, M

Lowercase letters: i, u, v, a, n, t, a, u, r

Digits: 0, 1, 7

Symbols: #, @, #, @
✔️ Uses all four character categories — Excellent!

3. Structure:

Appears to be a complex passphrase with some real-word elements (TiruvannamalaiPuram perhaps?) split with symbols and numbers.

This adds memorability while still being highly secure, thanks to added complexity and length.

4. Brute-force Resistance:
✔️ Extremely high — this password would take billions of years to crack via offline brute-force methods.

# Password - 3 B%J@m!n8Netany@#U

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b4bc1a0-4275-426c-952a-92b8a8fdaca1)


# Password Strength Analysis & Tips
```

1. Length: 18 characters ✅

✔️ Very strong – exceeds recommended minimum (12+).

2. Character Variety ✅

Uppercase letters: B, J, N, U

Lowercase letters: m, n, e, t, a, n, y

Digit: 8

Symbols: %, @, !, @, #

✔️ Contains all 4 character categories

3. Composition Quality ✅

Good blend of random elements and pronounceable parts (e.g., Netany)

Makes it easier to remember without sacrificing security

4. Compatibility ✅

✅ All characters are standard ASCII, ensuring compatibility with all websites, apps, and password managers

5. Brute-force Resistance ✅

Cracking this password using modern brute-force techniques would take billions of years

🔐 How Password Complexity Affects Security – Summary
=====
```
1. Increases Brute-Force Resistance

Longer and more complex passwords take exponentially more time to guess using brute-force attacks.

Example:

abcd1234 = crackable in seconds

B%J@m!n8Netany@#U = could take trillions of years

2. Defeats Common Attacks

Simple passwords are vulnerable to:

Dictionary attacks (guessing common words)

Credential stuffing (reusing leaked passwords)

Complexity adds randomness, making these attacks ineffective.

3. Involves Diverse Character Sets

The more types of characters used (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), the larger the possible combinations.

Example:

Only lowercase, 8 characters → 26⁸ = 208 billion combinations

Mixed characters, 18 characters → ~10⁴⁰+ combinations

4. Reduces Predictability

Complex passwords avoid:

Patterns (e.g., 123, password, qwerty)

Personal info (e.g., birthdate, name)

Random and non-repeating elements are harder to guess.

5. Must Be Balanced with Usability

Extremely complex passwords may be hard to remember.

Solution: Use a passphrase or a password manager.
