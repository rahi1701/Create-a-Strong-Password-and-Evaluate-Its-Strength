# Password Strength Analysis & Tips
```

1. Length: 14 characters ✅

Good — anything above 12 is generally strong.

2. Character Variety ✅

Lowercase letters: c, z, v, k, i

Uppercase letters: E, O, A

Digits: 0

Symbols: (, #, $, !, @
✔️ Contains all four character types — Excellent!

3. Randomness: Appears random and non-dictionary-based
✔️ No recognizable patterns or words — Great for resisting dictionary and pattern-based attacks.

4. Brute-force Resistance:
✔️ High — with current computing power, this would take centuries or longer to crack using offline brute-force methods.

This adds memorability while still being highly secure, thanks to added complexity and length.

4. Brute-force Resistance:
✔️ Extremely high — this password would take billions of years to crack via offline brute-force methods.
